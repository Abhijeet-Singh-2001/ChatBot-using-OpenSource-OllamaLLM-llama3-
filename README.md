ChatBot Using OllamaLLM (llama3)

# Python and C++ Code Generator Chatbot - Documentation
General Overview
This project is a Python-based chatbot that generates code solutions for user-provided programming tasks. It uses LangChain and Ollama (LLaMA 3) to interact with a local large language model (LLM). 

The system:
Accepts a user question or request.
Generates a well-commented, optimized Python and C++ code solution.
Outputs the solution in a JSON format, which is then extracted and displayed cleanly.
The chatbot also includes a mock fallback LLM, so it works even if Ollama is not running.

1. Dependencies
pip install langchain
pip install langchain-ollama

2. Technologies: Jupyter Notebook Python and Ollama Model
